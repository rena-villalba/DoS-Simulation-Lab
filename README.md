## Suricata + Iptables DoS & Port Scan Detection Lab

## Objective
This lab aims to simulate a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack and port scanning from one Linux virtual machine (VM) to another. The goal is to generate telemetry using two bash scripts: one that sends ICMP ping floods (DoS simulation) and another that performs multiple Nmap scans. The target VM, configured with Suricata (in IDS mode) and iptables, will detect and log both types of activity for analysis and potential integration with SIEM/SOAR tools.

## Requirements
- Two Linux-based VMs (Debian-based recommended)
- iptables (pre-installed on most Debian-based distros)
- suricata (previously installed and updated since we'll be using the Internal Network adapter)
- Bash script for DoS attack (ping flood)
- Bash script for port scanning (nmap usage)
- Static IP configuration for both VMs

## Project Tree
The following table shows where the configuration and script files from this repository should be placed in your virtual machines to ensure the lab functions correctly.

## Network Setup
| Role        | IP Address     | Description         |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Target VM   | `10.0.8.80/24` | Suricata + iptables |
| Attacker VM | `10.0.8.56/24` | Bash attack scripts |

1. Assign static IPs on both VMs using the 10.0.8.0/24 subnet.
2. Use ip a to confirm the IP addresses are set correctly.
3. Test connectivity using ping from one VM to the other.

## Firewall Setup (Target VM)
Instead of setting each iptables rule manually, we'll create a script that contains all the firewall rules. This provides centralized control and easier modification in the future. The script will be stored inside the /etc/iptables/rules directory.

Note: The rules allow traffic to flow into the VM so Suricata can inspect packets. In a real scenario, stricter filtering should be applied.

## Suricata Setup (Target VM)
Create a dedicated folder inside the directory /etc/suricata/rules/custom_rules and the files ping-flood.rules and port_scanning.rules, then we edit the suricata.yaml file to add the path for both rules.

## Attacker VM - Scripts
We can create both scripts inside the Desktop directory, in this case it doesn't matter where we store them since this machine will only send the "attacks".

## Attack & Detection Phase
On the Target VM: Open two terminals

- Terminal 1 ‚Äì Start Suricata

- Terminal 2 ‚Äì Monitor Logs (You can also use tools like jq or grep on eve.json to parse detailed alerts.)

## On the Attacker VM:
Run the scripts one by one and observe the detections:

- Script 1 - sudo flood_script.sh 10.0.8.80

- Script 2 - sudo scanning_script 10.0.8.80

And we can see how the target VM captures or trigger the alerts in real-time for each case.

## Conclusion
This simple lab helps visualize how traffic inspection tools like Suricata work with basic firewall configurations to detect and log suspicious activity like DoS attacks or port scans. While minimalistic, the setup is ideal for extending into SIEM/EDR/SOAR integrations or deeper network forensics.
